01.Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. 

14.Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings. If there is no common prefix, return an empty \
&ensp;&emsp;string "".

27.Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. \
&ensp;&emsp;Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

69.Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be \
&ensp;&emsp;non-negative as well. You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

88.You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of \
&ensp;&emsp;elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively. Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order. The final sorted 
&ensp;&emsp;array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. 

121.You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day. You want to maximize your profit by choosing a \
&ensp;&emsp;single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock. Return the maximum profit you can achieve from 
&ensp;&emsp;this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0. 

217.Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct. 

219.Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return true if there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that nums[i] == nums[j] \
&ensp; &emsp;and abs(i - j) <= k.

412.Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where: \
&ensp; &emsp;answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5. \
&ensp; &emsp;answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3. \
&ensp; &emsp;answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5. \
&ensp; &emsp;answer[i] == i (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.

485.Given a binary array nums, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array.

704.Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If \
&ensp;&emsp;target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

905.Given an integer array nums, move all the even integers at the beginning of the array followed by all the odd integers. Return any array that \
&ensp;&emsp;satisfies this condition.

953.In an alien language, surprisingly, they also use English lowercase letters, but possibly in a different order. The order of the alphabet is \
&ensp; &emsp;some permutation of lowercase letters. Given a sequence of words written in the alien language, and the order of the alphabet, return true 
&ensp; &emsp;if and only if the given words are sorted lexicographically in this alien language.

977.Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.

1299.Given an array arr, replace every element in that array with the greatest element among the elements to its right, and replace the last \
&emsp; &emsp;element with -1.After doing so, return the array.

1394.Given an array of integers arr, a lucky integer is an integer that has a frequency in the array equal to its value. Return the largest lucky \
&emsp; &emsp;integer in the array. If there is no lucky integer return -1.

1929.Given an integer array nums of length n, you want to create an array ans of length 2n where ans[i] == nums[i] and ans[i + n] == nums[i] \
&ensp; &emsp;for 0 <= i < n (0-indexed).Specifically, ans is the concatenation of two nums arrays.Return the array ans.

3110.You are given a string s. The score of a string is defined as the sum of the absolute difference between the ASCII values of adjacent \
&emsp; &emsp;characters.Return the score of s.
