01.Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. 

88.You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of \
&ensp;&emsp;elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively. Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order. The final sorted 
&ensp;&emsp;array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. 

121.You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day. You want to maximize your profit by choosing a \
&ensp;&emsp;single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock. Return the maximum profit you can achieve from 
&ensp;&emsp;this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0. 

217.Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct. 

219.Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return true if there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that nums[i] == nums[j] \
&ensp; &emsp;and abs(i - j) <= k.

953.In an alien language, surprisingly, they also use English lowercase letters, but possibly in a different order. The order of the alphabet is \
&ensp; &emsp;some permutation of lowercase letters. Given a sequence of words written in the alien language, and the order of the alphabet, return true 
&ensp; &emsp;if and only if the given words are sorted lexicographically in this alien language.
