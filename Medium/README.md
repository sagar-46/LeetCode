02.You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their \
&emsp;&ensp;nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

03.Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without duplicate characters.

11.You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn. Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a \
&emsp;&ensp;container, such that the container contains the most water. Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

15.Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.Notice that the \
&emsp;&ensp;solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

19.Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

31.A permutation of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.For example, the next permutation of 
&emsp;&ensp;arr = [1,2,3] is [1,3,2].Given an array of integers nums, find the next permutation of nums.

33.There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values). nums is possibly left rotated at an unknown index. Given the \
&emsp;&ensp;array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

53.Given an integer array nums, find the subarray with the largest sum, and return its sum.

152.Given an integer array nums, find a subarray that has the largest product, and return the product.

153.Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique \
&emsp;&emsp;elements, return the minimum element of this array.

155.Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time. \
&emsp;&emsp;Implement the MinStack class: \
&emsp;&emsp;-MinStack() initializes the stack object. \
&emsp;&emsp;-void push(int val) pushes the element val onto the stack. \
&emsp;&emsp;-void pop() removes the element on the top of the stack. \
&emsp;&emsp;-int top() gets the top element of the stack. \
&emsp;&emsp;-int getMin() retrieves the minimum element in the stack. \
&emsp;&emsp;You must implement a solution with O(1) time complexity for each function.

167.Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a \
&emsp;&ensp;specific target number. Return the indices of the two numbers added by one as an integer array of length 2.

172.Given an integer n, return the number of trailing zeroes in n!.

238.Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

503.Given a circular integer array nums (i.e., the next element of nums[nums.length - 1] is nums[0]), return the next greater number for every \
&emsp;&emsp;element in nums.The next greater number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means \
&emsp;&emsp;you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, return -1 for this number.

739.Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days \
&emsp;&ensp;you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 \
&emsp;&ensp;instead.

3100.You are given two integers numBottles and numExchange. numBottles represents the number of full water bottles that you initially have. \
&emsp;&emsp;In one operation, you can perform one of the following operations: \
&emsp;&emsp;Drink any number of full water bottles turning them into empty bottles. \
&emsp;&emsp;Exchange numExchange empty bottles with one full water bottle. Then, increase numExchange by one. \
&emsp;&emsp;Note that you cannot exchange multiple batches of empty bottles for the same value of numExchange. For example, if numBottles == 3  \
&emsp;&emsp;and numExchange == 1, you cannot exchange 3 empty water bottles for 3 full bottles. Return the maximum number of water bottles you \
&emsp;&emsp;can drink.

3217.You are given an array of integers nums and the head of a linked list. Return the head of the modified linked list after removing all nodes \
&emsp;&emsp;from the linked list that have a value that exists in nums.
