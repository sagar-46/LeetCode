33.There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values). nums is possibly left rotated at an unknown index. Given the \
&emsp;&ensp;array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

53.Given an integer array nums, find the subarray with the largest sum, and return its sum.

152.Given an integer array nums, find a subarray that has the largest product, and return the product.

153.Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique \
&emsp;&emsp;elements, return the minimum element of this array.

238.Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].
