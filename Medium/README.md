11.You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn. Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a \
&emsp;&ensp;container, such that the container contains the most water. Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

15.Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.Notice that the \
&emsp;&ensp;solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

33.There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values). nums is possibly left rotated at an unknown index. Given the \
&emsp;&ensp;array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

53.Given an integer array nums, find the subarray with the largest sum, and return its sum.

152.Given an integer array nums, find a subarray that has the largest product, and return the product.

153.Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique \
&emsp;&emsp;elements, return the minimum element of this array.

167.Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a \
&emsp;&ensp;specific target number. Return the indices of the two numbers added by one as an integer array of length 2.

238.Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].
